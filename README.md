## Dog-Breed-Predictor

**Who's a good dog? Who likes ear scratches? Well, it seems those fancy deep neural networks don't have all the answers. However, maybe they can answer that ubiquitous question we all ask when meeting a four-legged stranger: what kind of good pup is that?**

* In This project we look to create a deep learning model that can receive a picture of a dog and identify what breed of dog it is. This is an interesting problem because if successful it could be useful in reducing the amount of manual effort required to categorise large volumes of unlabelled image data.
